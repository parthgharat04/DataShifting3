# Data Shifting Removal Application

A production-ready web-based application for fixing data shifting issues in delimited text files. The application provides a robust, user-friendly interface for uploading, processing, and downloading fixed data files with enhanced multi-line transaction handling.

## üöÄ Enhanced Features

- **Advanced Data Shifting Correction**: Fixes complex issues where newlines are embedded within text-qualified fields
- **Intelligent Multi-Line Detection**: Automatically detects and combines broken transactions spanning multiple lines
- **Enhanced Embedded Quotes Handling**: Properly handles embedded quotes within fields, including inch marks (e.g., "60"")
- **Robust Transaction Reconstruction**: Can handle transactions spanning up to 25 lines for complex descriptions
- **Multi-User Support**: Supports concurrent usage from different browsers or machines with session isolation
- **Advanced Space and Tab Handling**: Trims extra spaces to a single space and replaces tabs with spaces
- **Intelligent Folder Maintenance**: Automatically cleans up old files to prevent accumulation
- **Comprehensive Error Logging**: Provides detailed error logs and error transaction files for problematic records
- **Professional Web Interface**: User-friendly interface with file upload, processing options, and results display

## üîß Technical Overview

### Enhanced Data Processing Features

- **Advanced Multi-Line Detection**: Intelligently identifies incomplete transactions and combines related lines
- **Smart Line Combination**: Combines broken lines until proper column count is achieved (up to 25 lines)
- **Embedded Quotes Handling**: Correctly handles embedded quotes (e.g., `"CAP-GOWN PKG ULTRA NAVY 60""`)
- **Qualified Content Cleaning**: Replaces newlines with spaces, normalizes spaces, and replaces tabs
- **Enhanced Column Counting**: Accurately counts columns respecting text qualifiers with improved logic
- **Pattern Detection**: Detects common patterns like inch marks in measurements and complex descriptions
- **Intelligent Text Processing**: Distinguishes between embedded quotes in text and measurement units
- **Edge Case Handling**: Successfully processes very long descriptions (medical equipment, software details, etc.)

### Multi-User Support

The application uses session-based management to ensure different users can process files concurrently:

- Each user automatically receives a unique session ID using UUID
- User-specific folders are created for both uploads and outputs
- Files from different users are completely isolated from each other
- Session persistence allows users to return and access their previous files
- All file operations are contained within user-specific directories

### File Maintenance

- **Automatic Cleanup**: The system automatically manages disk space
- **Recent Files**: Only keeps the most recent files in each user's folders
- **Uploads Folder**: Keeps the last 10 uploaded files per user
- **Outputs Folder**: Maintains the last 20 output files per user
- **Inactive Users**: Folders for users inactive for 7+ days are automatically removed
- **Graceful Error Handling**: The system continues to function even if files are missing

## üìñ Usage

### Web Interface
1. Start the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the web interface: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Upload your file (supports .txt, .csv, .dat, .tsv)
4. Set the appropriate delimiter (default: `|^|`) and qualifier (default: `"`)
5. Click "Process File"
6. Download the processed files and review any error logs

### Command Line Usage

The core functionality can also be used from the command line:

```bash
# Basic usage
python data_shifting.py input.txt output.txt

# With custom delimiter and qualifier
python data_shifting.py input.txt output.txt --delimiter "|^|" --qualifier "\""

# With error logging
python data_shifting.py input.txt output.txt --error_file errors.log --error_transactions_file error_transactions.txt

# Run built-in tests
python data_shifting.py --test
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
python data_shifting.py --test
```

The test suite validates:
- Basic embedded quotes handling
- Inch measurement conversions
- Complex pattern recognition
- Column counting accuracy
- Line combination logic

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- Werkzeug

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask werkzeug
```

## üìÅ File Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application with multi-user support and enhanced error handling
- `data_shifting.py`: Enhanced core data shifting correction logic with advanced multi-line detection
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the professional web interface
- `uploads/`: Root directory for user-specific upload folders
- `outputs/`: Root directory for user-specific output folders

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The tool generates three types of files:

1. **Corrected File**: Contains the fixed data with corrected line transactions
2. **Error Log File**: Detailed information about any issues encountered during processing
3. **Error Transactions File**: Only contains the problematic data rows for easy review

The application includes robust error handling:
- Files that don't exist are gracefully handled with appropriate user feedback
- Processing errors don't crash the application
- Missing error transaction files don't cause FileNotFoundError exceptions
- Comprehensive logging of all multi-line transaction fixes

## üí° Examples

### Simple Data Shifting Fix

**Input (with data shifting):**
```
Name|^|Age|^|Description
"John Doe"|^|30|^|"Software
Engineer"
"Jane Smith"|^|28|^|"Data Analyst"
```

**Output (corrected):**
```
Name|^|Age|^|Description
"John Doe"|^|30|^|"Software Engineer"
"Jane Smith"|^|28|^|"Data Analyst"
```

### Complex Multi-Line Transaction Fix

**Input (complex medical equipment description):**
```
"SU-1000523"|^|"Net 30"|^|"United States"|^|"325-05050B
Nursing Anne Manikin Dark
1 Adult, Female, Full-Body Manikin, 1
Female Multi-Venous IV Training Arm-
Left, 1 Female Blood Pressure
Training Arm-Right, 1 Blood Pressure

Includes Gift Box"|^|"Lab Equipment"
```

**Output (fully reconstructed):**
```
"SU-1000523"|^|"Net 30"|^|"United States"|^|"325-05050B Nursing Anne Manikin Dark 1 Adult, Female, Full-Body Manikin, 1 Female Multi-Venous IV Training Arm- Left, 1 Female Blood Pressure Training Arm-Right, 1 Blood Pressure Cuff, 1 Male Genitalia, 1 Female Genitalia, 3 Urinary Connector Valves, 3 Anal Connector Valves, 4 Clamps, 1 100cc Slip Tip Syringe, 1 Can Manikin Lubricant, 1 Hospital Gown and Includes Gift Box"|^|"Lab Equipment"
```

## üéØ Special Case Handling

The application correctly handles special cases such as:

1. **Embedded quotes**: `"ADB will apply SSL Certificates for WGU Complio "Splash pages""`
2. **Inch measurements**: `"CAP-GOWN PKG ULTRA NAVY 60""` ‚Üí `"CAP-GOWN PKG ULTRA NAVY 60 inches"`
3. **Multiple spaces**: Converts `"Multiple   spaces"` to `"Multiple spaces"`
4. **Tabs in text**: Replaces tabs with spaces for cleaner output
5. **Complex multi-line descriptions**: Medical equipment, software specifications, detailed product descriptions
6. **Very long transactions**: Handles descriptions spanning up to 25 lines

## üîí Production Features
